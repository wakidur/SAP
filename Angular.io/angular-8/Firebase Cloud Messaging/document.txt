Google Cloud Messaging ...........

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably deliver messages at no cost.

Using FCM
=> You can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. 
=> You can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. 
=> For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to 4KB to a client app. 

Key capabilities
  1. Send notification message or data messages.
  2. Versatile message targeting : Distribute messages to your client app in any of 3 waysâ€”
        to single devices, 
        to groups of devices, or 
        to devices subscribed to topics.
  3. Send messages from client apps


How does it work?

An FCM implementation includes two main components for sending and receiving

1. A trusted environment such as Cloud Functions for Firebase or an app server on which to build, target, and send messages.
2. An iOS, Android, or web (JavaScript) client app that receives messages.

You can send messages via the Firebase Admin SDK or the FCM server protocols. For testing or for sending marketing or engagement messages with powerful built-in targeting and analytics, you can also use the Notifications composer.

Implementation path

/************** Set up a JavaScript Firebase Cloud Messaging client app ***********/
The FCM JavaScript API lets you receive notification messages in web apps running in browsers that support the Push API. This includes the browser versions listed in this support matrix.
