1. Quick Look Back at Data Services for Simple Apps
    This book is about learning to structure your application and learning how to set up and communicate your application's state, and its changes, in a way that all parts of your application are in agreement on what is happening.

    The underlying architectural pattern for NgRx is Redux, which constrains data to live in only one place and ensures data is flowing in only one direction. 

    The Flux pattern has a lot in common with Redux and it is its shortcomings that led to Redux being created. NgRx itself is implemented using RxJS, which promotes a functional reactive style of programming.

        1.1.1.	Cohesion and coupling – establishing a common language
            Cohesion: Cohesion is about focus and what the class should do. 
            The lower the cohesion/connection/linkage, the more different thing are performed by a class and therfor it has no clear intention of what it should perform. 

            What about coupling? 
                Coupling is about how strongly connected a software element is to another software element.

        1.2.2.	The component – a controller and a building block
            In the context of MVC, the component is the V and C, the view and the controller. The component allows you to define either a separate template file or an inline template. The template is the view part.

            The controller in this context is a component class file that handles user interactions and also fetches the necessary data for the template to display.

            Components have come to be a central concept for a lot of frameworks that are popular today, such as React, Vue.js, and Polymer. 

            A component can take inputs, which are either data or methods. It consists of a piece of code and an HTML template, which render interesting data, living on the component. A component in Angular consists of three major parts:
                •	A decorator function
                •	A class
                •	A template
            
            A component consists of a controller class and a template. It can play two different roles in an Angular application: either it can be the responder to the route or it can serve as a building block. In the first case, Angular will instantiate it when a new route happens and respond with that component. In the latter case, the component is created directly by existing as a child component within another component.
