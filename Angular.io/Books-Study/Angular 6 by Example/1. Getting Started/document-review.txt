1. Getting Started
    Developing applications in JavaScript is always a challenge. Due to its malleable nature and lack of type checking, building a decent-sized application in JavaScript is difficult. Moreover, we use JavaScript for all types of processes, such as user interface (UI) manipulation, client-server interaction, and business processing/validations. As a result, we end up with spaghetti code that is difficult to maintain and test.

        1.1.5. Angular modules
            Components are the basic building block of an Angular application. But how do we then organize these building block into complete applications? Angular modules provide the answer to this question. They enable us to combine our components into reusable groups of funcationality that can be exported and imported throughout our application.

            *** The standard practice while building user interfaces is to build them top-down. Start by designing the UI and then plug in the data and behavior according to your needs. With such an approach, the UI, data, and behavioral aspects of the app are all tightly coupled, which is a less than ideal situation!

Architecture in Angular projects

So I took some time to rethink the whole thing and implement a decent architecture for Angular apps, with these goals in mind:

consistency: simplicity (for small apps) and scalability (for big apps),
reusability in different projects,
optimization (consistent with or without lazy-loading),
testability.

Angular modules
    What is a NgModule?
        The purpose of a NgModule is just to group components and/or serverces which belong together. Nothing more or less.

    Types of Angular modules
        There are 3 main types of NgModules you can do:

        modules of pages,
        modules of global services,
        modules of reusable components.

        Modules of pages 
            Modules of pages are modules with routing. They are here to separate and organize the different areas of your application. They are loaded only once, either in the AppModule or via lazy-loading.
        Shared services for pages
        Pages: routed components
        Modules of global services
        Should I do a CoreModule?
        Modules of reusable components
