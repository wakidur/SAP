        7.2.3. The Angular testing ecosystem
            At the moment, the Angular testing library works by default with Jasmine
            All the tests in this chapter are written using Jasmine (both unit and integration tests). Karma will be our test runner for unit tests and Protractor for E2E tests.

    7.3. Getting started with unit testing
        The ultimate aim of unit testing is to test a specific piece of code/component in isolation to make sure that the components work according to the specification. This reduces the chances of failures/bugs in the component when integrated with other parts of the software.
