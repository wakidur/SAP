6. Angular Directives in Depth

    The topics we will cover in this chapter include the following
        •	Building directives
        •	Asynchronous validation
        •	Using renderer for view manipulation
        •	Host binding
        •	Directive injection
        •	Working with view children and content children
        •	Understanding the NgIf platform directive
        •	View encapsulation of Angular components

    6.1. Classifying directives
        Angular directive integrate the HTML view with the application state. Directive help us mainpulate views and application state changes and respond to view updates with little or no manual with the actual DOM 

        6.1.1. Components 
            The view is bound to the component implementation and it can only work with "properties" and "events" defined on the backing component. 
        6.1.2. Attribute directives
            Attribute directives, on the other hand, extend an existing component or HTML element. Consider them as behavioral extensions to these components/elements.
        
        6.1.3. Structural directives
            The purpose of a structural directive is to show/hide or clone the template view or clone the template view provided to it. 
    
    6.2. Building a remote validator directive
        Async validators are similar to standard custom validators, except that of returning a key-value object map or null, the return value of a validation check is a Promise. This provise is eventually resolved with the validation state being set (if there is an error) , or null otherwise (on validation success)
