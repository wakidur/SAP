Architecture overview: Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScirpt. Angular is written in TypeScirpt. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScirpt libraries that you import into your apps. 

The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components.

Modules: Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.
