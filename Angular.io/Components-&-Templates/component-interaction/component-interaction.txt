Component Interaction(মিথষ্ক্রিয়া)

This cookbook contains recipes for common component communication scenarios in which two or more components share information. 

1. Pass data from parent to child with input binding

2. Intercept(পথিমধ্যে রোধ করা, ধরে রাখা, আটকানো) input property changes with a setter.

    Use an input property setter to intercept and act upon a value from the parent.

3. Intercept input property changes with ngOnChanges()
    Detect and act upon changes to input property value with the "ngOnChanges()" method of the onChanges lifecycle hook interface.

    *** You may prefer this approach to the property setter when watching multiple, interacting input properties. 

4. Parent listens for child event
    The child component exposes(অনাবৃত) an EventEmitter property with which it "emits" events when something happens. The parent binds to that event property and reacts to this events.

    The child's EventEmitter property is an output property, typically adorned(সুশোভিত, অলঙ্কৃত) with an @Output decoration as seen in this VoterComponent.
