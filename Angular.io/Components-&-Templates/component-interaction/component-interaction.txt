Component Interaction(মিথষ্ক্রিয়া)

This cookbook contains recipes for common component communication scenarios in which two or more components share information. 

1. Pass data from parent to child with input binding

2. Intercept(পথিমধ্যে রোধ করা, ধরে রাখা, আটকানো) input property changes with a setter.

    Use an input property setter to intercept and act upon a value from the parent.

3. Intercept input property changes with ngOnChanges()
    Detect and act upon changes to input property value with the "ngOnChanges()" method of the onChanges lifecycle hook interface.

    *** You may prefer this approach to the property setter when watching multiple, interacting input properties.
