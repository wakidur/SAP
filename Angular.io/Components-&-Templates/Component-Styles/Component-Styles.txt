Angular applications are styled with standard CSS. That measn you can apply everything you know about css stylesheets, selectors, rules, and media queries directly to Angular applications.

Additionally, Angular can bundle "component styles" with components, enabling a more modular design than reqular stylesheets.

1. Using component styles
    For every Angular component you write, you may define not only an HTML template, but also the css style that go with that template, specifying and selectors, rules, and media queries that you need. 

    One way to do this is to set the styles property in the component metedata. The styles property takes an array of strings that contain css code.



2. Style scope 
    *** The styles specified in @Component metadata apply only within the template of the component.

    

3. Special selectors
