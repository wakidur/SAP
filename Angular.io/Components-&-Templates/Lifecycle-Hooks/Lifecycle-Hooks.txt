1. Lifecycle Hooks
A component has a lifecycle managed by Angular.
Angular create it, renders it, creates and renders its children, checkes it when its data-bound(বাধ্য, নিবন্ধিত) properties change, and destroys(ধ্বংস) it berfor removing it from the DOM. 

2. Component lifecycle hooks overview
    Directive and component instances have a lifecycle as Angular creates, updates, and destroys them. Developers can tab(টোকা দেত্তয়া) into key moments in that lifecycle by implementing (বাস্তবায়ন করে) one or more of the lifecycle hook interfaces in the Angular core library.


3. Lifecycle sequence
    After creating a component/directive by calling its constructor, Angular calls the lifecycle hook methods in the following sequence at specific moments.

    1. ngOnChange() : Respond when Angular(rs) sets data-bound input properties. The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values. called befor ngOnInit() and whenever one or more data-bound imput properties change. 

    2. ngOnInit(): initialize(আরম্ভ) the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive/component's input propeties. called once, after the first ngOnChange().

    3. ngDoCheck(): Detect(সন্ধান করে বার করা) and act(কাজ) upon(উপরে) changes that Angular can't or won't detact on its own. Called during every change detection run, immediately after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit(). 

    4. ngAfterContentInit(): Respond  after Angular projects external content into the component's view / the view that a directive is in. called once after the first ngDoCheck(). 

    5. ngAfterContentChecked(): Respond after Angular checks the content projected(অভিক্ষিপ্ত) into the directive/component. Called after the ngAfterContenInit() and every subsequent ngDoCheck(). 

    6. ngAfterViewInit(): Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views/ the view that a directive is in. Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked().

    7. ngAfterViewChecke(): Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views/ the view that a directive is in. 
    Called after the ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked()

    8. ngOnDestroy(): Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component. Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks. 
    called just berfor Angular destroys the directive/component. 

4. Interfaces are optional (technically)

    The interfaces are optional(ঐচ্ছিক) for JavaScript and Typescript Developers from a purely technical(প্রযুক্তিগত) perspactive(পরিপ্রেক্ষিত). The JavaScript language doesn't have interfaces. 
    Angular can't see Typescript interfaces at runtime because they disappear(অদৃশ্য) from the transpiled Javascript.

    Fortunately(ভাগ্যক্রমে), they aren't necessary. You don't have to add the lifecycle hook interfaces to directives and components to benefit from the hooks themselves.

    Angular instead inspects(পরিদর্শন করা) directive and component classes and calls the hook methods if they are defined. Angular finds and calls methods like ngOnInit(), with or without the interfaces.

    Nonetheless(তবু, অথচ), it's good pracitce to add interfaces to TypeScript directive classes in order to benefite from strong typing and editor tooling

5. Other Angular lifecycle hooks

//29-05-2018----------------------------------
6. Lifecycle examples.

Demonstrates(প্রমান, স্পষ্ট করা)
a. peek-a-boo. (Demonstrates every lifecycle hook. Each hook method writes to the on-screen log);
b. spy (Directive have lifecycle hooks too. A SpyDirective can log when the element it spies upon is created or destroyed using the ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy hooks)
c. OnChanges.( See how Angular calls the ngOnChanges() hook with a changes object every time one of the component input properties changes. Shows how to interpret the changes object. ) 
d. DoCheck (Implements an ngDoCheck() method with custom change detection. See how often Angular calls this hook and watch it post changes to a log.)
e. AfterView (Shows what Angular means by a view. Demonstrates the ngAfterViewInit and ngAfterViewChecked hooks.)
f. AfteContent(Shows how to project external content into a component and how to distinguish projected content from a component's view children. Demonstrates the ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterContentChecked hooks.)
g. Counter (Demonstrates a combination of a component and a directive each with its own hooks.

In this example, a CounterComponent logs a change (via ngOnChanges) every time the parent component increments its input counter property. Meanwhile, the SpyDirective from the previous example is applied to the CounterComponent log where it watches log entries being created and destroyed.)
