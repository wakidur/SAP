Angular Elements Overview
Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements, a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. 

Custom elements are a Web platform feature currently supported by Chrome, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through polyfills. A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content(পরিমাণ) is created and controlled by JavaScritp code. The browser maintains a CustomElementRegistery of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScritp class to an HTML tag

The @angular/elements package exports a createCustomElement() API that provies a bridge from Angular's component interface and change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API 

Transforming a component to a custom element makes all of the required Angular infrastructure available to the browser. Creating a custom element is simple and straightforward, and automatically connects your component-defined view with change detection and data binding, mapping Angular functionality to the corresponding native HTML equivalents.
