1. Angular Elements Overview

Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements, a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. 

Custom Elements are Web Platform feature currently supported by Chrome, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through polyfills . 

A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content  is created and controlled by JavaScript code. 

The browser maintains a " CustomElementRegistery " of defined custom elements(also called Web Components ), which maps an instantiable  JavaScript class to an HTML tag. 

The @angular/elements package exports a " createCustomElement() " API that provides a bridge from Angular's component interface and change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API.

Transforming a component to a custom element makes all of the required Angular infrastructure available to the browser. Creating a custom element is simple and straightforward, and automatically connects your component-defined view with change detection and data binding mapping Angular functionality to the corresponding native HTML equivalents.

2. Using custom element
	Custom elements bootstrap themselves- they start automatically when they are added to the DOM, and are automatically destroyed when removed from the DOM. Once a custom element is added to the DOM for any page, it looks and behaves like any other HTML element, and does not required any special knowledge of Angular terms or usage conventions.
	
	2.1 Easy dynamic content in an Angular app.
		Transforming a component to a custom element provides an easy path to creating dynamic HTML content in your Angular App. 
	2.2 Content-rich applications 
		If you have a content-rich app, such as the Angular app that presents this documentation, custom elements let you give your content providers sophisticated Angular functionality without requiring knowledge of Angular.

3. How it works

	Use the " createCustomElement()" function to convert a component into a class that can be registered with the browser's custom element. After you registry, your configured class with the browser's custom-element registry.
