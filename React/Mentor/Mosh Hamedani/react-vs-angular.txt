React vs. Angular: The Complete Comparison

History of React vs. Angular
 1. Architecture of React vs. Angular
    Framework vs. Library
    => Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework and React is merely a JavaScript Library (just the view).

        Angular provides the following “out of the box”:
            Templates, based on an extended version of HTML
            XSS protection
            Dependency injection
            Ajax requests by @angular/HTTP
            Routing, provided by @angular/router
            Component CSS encapsulation
            Utilities for unit-testing components.
            @angular/forms for building forms
        
        React, on the other hand, gives you much more freedom. It only provides the “view” in MVC – you need to solve the M and C on your own.

            In addition, each React project is different and requires a decision requiring its folder hierarchy and architecture. Things can go wrong much more easily due to this.

        React provides the following “out of the box”:
            Instead of classic templates, it has JSX, an XML-like language built on top of JavaScript
            XSS protection
            No dependency injection
            Fetch for Ajax requests
            Utilities for unit-testing components
        Some popular libraries to add functionality are:

            React-router for routing
            Redux or MobX for state management
            Enzyme for additional testing utilities
2. Regular DOM vs. Virtual Dom
    - React’s use of a virtual DOM . A virtual DOM only looks at the differences between the previous and current HTML and changes the part that is required to be updated. 

    - Angular opted to use a regular DOM. This will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the user’s age.

    Templates – JSX or HTML
        React decided to combine UI templates and inline JavaScript logic, which no company had ever done before. The result is called “JSX”. Although it may have sounded like a bad idea, Facebook’s gamble paid off big-time. React uses something called a component, which contains both the markup AND logic in the same file. It also uses an XML-like language that allows you to write markup directly in your JavaScript code. JSX is a big advantage for development, because you have everything in one place, and code completion and compile-time checks work better
