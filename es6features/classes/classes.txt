/******************* 1.Defining classes ***************/
Classes are fact(প্রকৃত ঘটনা, প্রকৃত অবস্থা) "special functions", and just as you can define "function expressions" and "function declaration", the class syntax has two components
1. class expressions
2. class declarations


//---------Class declarations----------

One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class("Rectangle" )

A. Hoisting
An important difference between "function declarations" and "class declarations" is that function declaration are hoisted and class declaration are not. you first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a RefernceError.

//-----------Class expressions----------
A class expression is another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name give to a named class expressions is local to the class's body. ( it can be retrived through the class's (not an instanc's).name property, thought);
