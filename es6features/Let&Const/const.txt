What is const?
    Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment(পুনরায় নিয়োগ), and it can't be redeclared(পুনরায় ঘোষিত).

1. Syntax
    const name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2 [, ... [, nameN = valueN]]];
