Arrows are a function shorthand using the " => " syntax. They are syntactically(চিহ্নগুলি সিন্টেক্সের) similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript. They support both 
1. statement block bodies 
    as well as (পাশাপাশি  )
2. expression bodies which return the value of the expression.
3. Unlike functions,arrows share the same lexical(আভিধানিক) this as their surrounding code

Descripting: -----------
Two factors(কারণের) influence(প্রভাবিত) the introduction(ভূমিকা) of arraow function.
    1. Shorter Functions
    2. non-binding(অ বাঁধাই) of This

No separate this---------
Until(পর্যন্ত) arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value (a new object in the case of a constructor, undefined in strict mode function calls, the base object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). This proved to be less than ideal with an object-oriented style of programming.


In ECMAScript 3/5, the this issue was fixable by assigning the value in this to a variable that could be closed over.
