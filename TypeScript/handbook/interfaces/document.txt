/*********************************** Interfaces ***********************/
One of TypeScript's core principles is that type-checking(টাইপ-পরীক্ষণ) focuses on the shape(আকৃতি) that value have. This is something called "duck typing" or "structural subtyping". In TypeScript, interfaces fill(পূরণ করা) the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts(চুক্তি) within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.
