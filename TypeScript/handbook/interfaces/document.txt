/*********************************** Interfaces ***********************/
One of TypeScript's core principles is that type-checking(টাইপ-পরীক্ষণ) focuses on the shape(আকৃতি) that value have. This is something called "duck typing" or "structural subtyping". In TypeScript, interfaces fill(পূরণ করা) the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts(চুক্তি) within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.

2. Readonly properties
    2.1 readonly vs const
        Variables use const whereas propeties use readonly.

3. Excess Property Checks
