    Function Types 
        Typing the function
            we can add types to each of the parameters and then to the function itself to add a return type. 
            TypeScript can figure the return type out by looking at the return statements, so we can also optionlly leave this off in many cases.

Inferring the types: In playing with the example, you may notice that the TypeScript compiler can figure out the type if you have types on one side of the equation but not the other:
This is called “contextual typing”, a form of type inference. This helps cut down on the amount of effort to keep your program typed.
