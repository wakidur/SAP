/***************** Variable Declarations ******************/

let: is similar to var in some respects 
const: is an augmentation of let in that it prevents reassignment to a variable.


/***** Scoping rules *****/
var declaration have some odd scoping rules for those used to(ব্যবহৃত) other languages.

These scoping rules can cause several types of mistakes. One problem they exacerbate is the fact that it is not an error to declare the same variable multiple times.

May be it was easy to spot(স্থাননির্ণয় করা) out for some, but the inner for loop will accidentlly overwrite the variable i because i refers to the same function-scoped variable. As experienced developers know by now, similar sorts of bugs slip code reviews and code be an endless source of frustration.

/* Block-scoping */
When a variable is declared using let, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or block-scoping.
