broadly(বিস্তৃতভাবে, ব্যাপকভাবে)
AngularJS incorporates its animation infrastructure as a separete module, ngAnimate. With this, you are able to tackle animating your application in several different ways,
which are as follows:
    1. CSS3 transitions
    2. CSS3 animations
    3. JavaScript animations


Creating a simple fade in/out animation-------------------------

integrating (একীভূত)
demonstrate(প্রদর্শন করা)
AngularJS animations work by integrating CSS animations into a directive class-based finite state machine.
** A finite state machine (FSM) is a computational system model defined by
the states and transition conditions between them.

The animation CSS classes need to cover both cases, 
where the element is hidden and needs to fade in, and 
where the element is shown and needs to fade out.  
As is the case with CSS transitions, 
    1. you need to define the initial state, 
    2. the final state, and 
    3. the transition parameters.
This can be done as follows

bi-directional(দ্বি-মুখী)
relevant(প্রাসঙ্গিক);

Replicating jQuery's slideUp() and slideDown() methods----------------------------
AngularJS provides hooks to define a custom animation when a directive fires an enter(প্রবেশ করান) event. The following directives will generate enter events.
1. ngIf: This fires the enter event just after the ngIf contents change, and a new
DOM element is created and injected into the ngIf container

2. ngInclude: This fires the enter event when new content needs to be brought into
the browser

3.  ngRepeat: This fires the enter event when a new item is added to the list or when
an item is revealed after a filter

4.  ngSwitch: This fires the enter event after the ngSwitch contents change, and the
matched child element is placed inside the container

5.  ngView: This fires the enter event when new content needs to be brought into
the browser

6.  ngMessage: This fires the enter event when an inner message is attached
