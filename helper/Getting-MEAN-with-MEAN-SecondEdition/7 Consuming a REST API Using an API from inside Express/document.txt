7 Consuming a REST API: Using an API from inside Express
    7.1   How to call an API from Express
        7.1.1   Adding the request module to our project
        7.1.2   Setting up default options
        7.1.3   Using the request module

        Option-------------------------------  Description ----------------------------------- Required-----------------

        url--------- Full URL of the request to be made, including protocol, domain, path, and URL parameters ------  Yes

        method------ The method of the request, such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE--------------- No—defaults to GET if not specified

        json--------- The body of the request as a JavaScript object; an empty object should be sent if no body data is needed ---Yes—ensures that the response body is also parsed as JSON

        qs---------- A JavaScript object representing any query string parameters------------------ No

            Making the request callback more robust
            Defining output messages based on the response data
            Updating the view to display the error messages
            Testing the API error trapping

                Our Express application is querying the API we built, which pulls data from the MongoDB database and passes it back to the application. When the application gets a response from the API, it works out what to do with it and either shows the data or an error messages in the browser.

        7.3.6   Creating status-specific error pages
            Catching all error codes

        7.4.2   POSTing the review data to the API

    7.5   Protecting data integrity with data validation
        7.5.1   Validating at the schema level with Mongoose
            Updating the schema
            Catching Mongoose validation errors
            Display an error message in the browser

// 30-07-2018 ---------------------
        7.5.2   Validating at the application level with Node and Express
            An application shouldn't rely solely on Validation at the Schema level, and you shold try to prevent unnecessery calls to the API, reducing overhead and speeding things up for the user. One way to do this is to add validation at the application level, checking the submitted data before sending to the API.

        
        7.5.3   Validating in the browser with jQuery

// 31-07-2018 ---------------------------------
            Just like application-level validation speeds things up by not requiring a call to the API, Client-side validation in the browser can speed things up by catching an error before the form is submitted to the application by removing yet another call. Catching an error at the point will keep the user on the same page.
