1 Introducing full-stack development
    This chapter covers 
        The benefits of full-stack development
        An overview of the MEAN stack components
        What makes the MEAN stack so compelling
        A preview of the application we'll build throughout this Book

The MEAN stack is a pure JavaScript stack comprised of four main technologies, with a cast of Supporting technologies

MongoDB:- the database (MongoDB has been around since 2007)
Express:- the web framework (Express was first released in 2009 by T. J. Holowaychuk )
Angular:- the front-end framework (Angular is open source and backed by Google 2010)
Node.js:- the web server (Node.js was created in 2009)
