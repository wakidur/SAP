        9.3.3 Controller best practice: Using the controllerAs syntax

            Defining the viewModel in the controller

            Getting the files to the browser
            Using the services from the controller
            Use $scope with needed
                The controllerAs syntax that wr're using is ideal for decluttering and avoiding abuse of $scope. Following this approach you only use $scope when you absolutely need it, which helps provide an addintional layour of clarity and understanding to your code and the process going on behind it.
                To use $scope.$apply in the home controller we just need to pass in $scope like any other dependency, and thane change the current vm.$apply calls back to $scope.$apply. The following listing show the changes needed.
