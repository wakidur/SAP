It presents(বিদ্যমান) DOM elements to users (buttons and form inputs, for example), and then responds to user input by firing(গুলি ছোড়া) events for the application to listen for and handle.


Event emitters(এমিটার্স)----------

Event aggregators( সংযোগকারীদের )-----------
an event aggregator is a central object that collects events
from multiple sources and delivers them to registered subscribers. This is essentially a
type of publish/subscribe pattern. An aggregator eliminates the need for specialized
mediators to keep an emitter and listener decoupled.
