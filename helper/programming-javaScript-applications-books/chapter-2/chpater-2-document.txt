Functions are the building blocks of applications.
JavaScript supports
    a. first-class functions

*****************Lambdas****************
A lambda is a function that is used as data. As such, it can be used the same way any
other expression can: as a parameter for another function, the return value of a function,
or anywhere you might use a literal value.

Example:
var sum = function sum() {
    var result = 0;
    [5, 5, 5].forEach(function addTo(number) { 
        result += number; 
        });
    return result;
};
The .addTo() function passed into .forEach() is a lambda.

**Lambdas are frequently confused with 
1.anonymous functions, 
2. closures, 
3. first-class functions, 
4. higher order functions. 
The concepts are all similar, but they mean different things
