1. REST – What You Did Not Know
    Representational State Transfer (REST)
        Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software Architectures.
    Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol- (HTTP) 
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    SOAP with Attachment References (SwaRef)
    Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).

    Let's look at the key principles around the HTTP and URI standards, sticking to which will make your HTTP application a RESTful service-enabled application:

        1. Everything is a resource
        2. Each resource is identifiable by a unique identifier (URI)
        3. Resources are manipulated via standard HTTP methods
        4. Resources can have multiple representations
        5. Communicate with resources in a stateless manner

        Principle 1 – Everything is a resource
To understand this principle, one must conceive of the idea of representing data by a
specific format and not by a physical file containing a bunch of bytes. Each piece of data
available on the internet has a format that describes it, known as the content type; for
example, JPEG images, MPEG videos, HTML, XML, text documents, and binary data are all
resources with the following content types: image/jpeg, video/mpeg, text/html, text/xml,
and application/octet-stream.
