1.Schemas
 1.2 Defining your schema
    Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape(আকৃতি) of the documents within that collection.
    
    The Primitted SchemaTypes are 

        a. String
        b. Number
        c. Data
        d. Buffer
        e. Boolean 
        f. Mixed
        g. ObjectId
        h. Array
    
    Schemas not only define the structure of your document and casting of properties, they also define documents 
        instance methodes,
        static Model methodes,
        compound indexes,
        document lifecycle hooks called middleware.
