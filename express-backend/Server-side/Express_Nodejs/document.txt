/********* 1. Express web framework (Node.js/JavaScript) ***********/
Express is a popular unopinionated(একমত)  web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the node.js runtime enviroment.

2.1. What is Node?
2.2. What is Express?
2.3. What makes the Express web framework special.

2.1 & 2.2 => What are Express and Node?

Node: is a open-source, cross-platform, runtime enviroment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended(লক্ষ্য)  for use outside of a browser context. As such, the enviroment omits(বাদ) browser-specific JavaScript APIs and Adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries. 

Express: is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underliying libary for a number of other popular Node web framework. it provides mechanisms to.

*** While Express itself is fairly minimalist, developers have creted compatible middlewar packages  to address almost any web development problem. There are libraries to work with

A. cookies,
B. Sessions
C. User Login,
D. URL parameters,
C. POST data,
E. Security headers


2.4 Where did it come from?
Express was initially released in November 2010 and is currently on version 4.16 of the API. 

2.5 How popular is Node/Express?

2.6 Is Express opinionated(	অটল বিশ্বাসী )?
Express is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like. 


2.7 What does Express code look like?

	2.7.1 Helloworld Express
	
	1. line one      => var express = require('express');
    2. line two 	 => var app = express();
    3. line three  	 => app.get('/', function(req, res) {
							res.send('Hello World!');
						});
    4. line four 	=>  app.listen(3000, function() {
							console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
						});

	
	The first two lines require() (import) the express module and create an Express application. The object, which is traditionally named app, 

	A. has methods for routing HTTP requests,
	B. Configuring middleware,
	C. rendering HTML views,
	D. Registering a template engine
	E. Modifying application settings that control how the application behaves 

	The middle part of the code (the three lines starting with app.get) shows a route definition.

	2.7.2 Importing and creating modules

	Module: A module is a JavaScript library/ file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function.
	Express itself is a module, as are the middlewar and database libraries that we use in our Express applications.

	2.7.3 Using asynchronous APIs

	2.7.4 Creating route handlers
		JavaScript tip: You can use any argument names you like in the callback functions; when the callback is invoked the first argument will always be the request and the second will always be the response. It makes sense to name them such that you can identify the object you're working with in the body of the callback.

		The Express application object also provides methods to define route handlers for all the other HTTP vars, which are mostly used in exactly the same way
		post();
		put();
		delete();
		options();
		trace();
		copy();
		lock();
		mkcol();
		move();
		purge();
		propfind();
		proppatch();
		unlock();
		report();
		mkactivity();
		checkout();
		merge();
		m-search();
		notify();
		subscribe();
		unsubscribe();
		patch();
		search();
		connect();
