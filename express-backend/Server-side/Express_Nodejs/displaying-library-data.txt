1. Overview
    In our previous tutorial articles we defined Mongoose models that can use to interact with a database and created some initaal libary recode. We the created all the routes needed for the LocalLibaray website, but with "dummy controller" function (these are skeleton controller function that just return a "not implemented" message when a page is accessed).

    At the end of this article you should have a good end-to-end understanding of 
    how routes, 
    asynchonus function,
    view,
    models
    work in practice

    2.1 Asynchronous flow control using async
    async.parallel();
    async.series();
    async.waterfall();
        2.1.1 Why is this needed?
        2.1.2 Asynchronous operations in parallel
            The method "async.parallel()" is used to ren multiple Asynchronous operation in parallel. The first argument to "async.parallel()" is a collection of the asynchronous functions to run(an array, object or other iterable). Each function is passed a callback(err, result) which it must call on completion with an error err(which can be null) and optional results value.

        2.1.3 Asynchronous operations in series 
            The method "async.series()" is used to run multiple asynchronous operations in sequence, when subsequent function do not depend on the output of earlier function. It is essentially declared and behaves in the same way as "async.parallel()"
        2.1.4 Dependent asynchronous operations in series
            The method "async.waterfall()" is used to run multiple asynchronous operations in sequence when each operation is dependent on the result of the previous operation.

            The callback invoked by each asynchronous function contains null for the first argument and results in subsequenct arguments. Each function in the series takes the result arguments of the previous callback as the first parameters, and then a callback function. When all operations are complete, a final callback is invoked with the result of the last operation.
