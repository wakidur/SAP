Hi all, I recently co-authored a web development book. Today and tomorrow, I'd like to offer a free copy to members of this group.

The book teaches you how to build a JavaScript web app from scratch (with React, Material-UI, Next, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB) and integrate it with third party APIs (Google, Github, AWS SES, Mailchimp, Stripe).

More about the book: https://builderbook.org/book

Introduction chapter: https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction

Final app you build: https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook

If you're interested, please send me an email at team@builderbook.org by Tuesday, March 20. Mention this post the in the JavaScript group. I'd also love to hear why you're interested or how you think the book will help you
