Hi all, I recently co-authored a web development book. Today and tomorrow, I'd like to offer a free copy to members of this group.

The book teaches you how to build a JavaScript web app from scratch (with React, Material-UI, Next, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB) and integrate it with third party APIs (Google, Github, AWS SES, Mailchimp, Stripe).

More about the book: https://builderbook.org/book

Introduction chapter: https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction

Final app you build: https://github.com/builderbook/builderbook

If you're interested, please send me an email at team@builderbook.org by Tuesday, March 20. Mention this post the in the JavaScript group. I'd also love to hear why you're interested or how you think the book will help you

/***** Express Tutorial Part 3: Using a Database (with Mongoose) **********/
	1. Overview : Library staff will use the Local Library website to store information about books and borrowers(ঋণ গ্রহীতাদের), while library members will use it to browse it to browse and search for books, find out whether there are any copies available, and reserve or borrow(ধার করা) them. In order to store and retrieve information efficiently, we will store it in a Database

	2. What databases can I use?
		Express apps can use any databases supported by Node( Express itself doesn't define any specific additional behaviour/requirements for database management). There are many popular options, including 
			a. PostgreSQL
			b. MySQL 
			c. Redis
			d. SQLite
			e. MongoDB
		When choosing a database, you should consider things like 
			a. time-to-productivity
			b. learning curve
			c. performance
			d. easy of replication
			e. easy backup
			f. cost 
			g. community support

	3. What is the best way to interact(পরস্পরের উপর ক্রিয়া করা) with a database?
		
		There are two approaches for interacting with database
			1. Using the databases native query language ( SQL )
			2. Using an Object Data Model
